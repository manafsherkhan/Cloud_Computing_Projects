Successfully Deployed Secure CloudBridge Infrastructure for Cross-Region Site-to-Site VPN Connection from On-Premises to AWS SiteðŸš€ Successfully Deployed Secure CloudBridge Infrastructure for Cross-Region Site-to-Site VPN Connection from On-Premises to AWS Site

- Multi-Region VPC Setup: Created two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in different regions - Tokyo and Singapore - to establish a robust network infrastructure.

- EC2 Instance Deployment: Set up two EC2 instances within each VPC to serve as endpoints for the VPN connection.

- VPN Configuration: Utilized AWS services to configure a VPN connection in the Mumbai region, ensuring secure communication between on-premises infrastructure and AWS cloud resources.

- Customer Gateway Establishment: Created a customer gateway to facilitate the secure connection between the on-premises network and the AWS cloud.

- Site-to-Site Connection: Established a site-to-site connection between the on-premises network and the AWS VPC, enabling seamless data transfer and communication.

- Route Table Propagation: Configured route tables to propagate routes between the on-premises network and the AWS VPC, ensuring efficient traffic routing.

- VPN Configuration Download: Downloaded VPN configuration files to enable secure communication channels between the on-premises network and AWS resources.

- Remote Access: Gained access to the EC2 instance in the Tokyo region to configure necessary settings and ensure smooth operation of the infrastructure.

- Configuration Commands: Implemented various configuration commands to fine-tune the VPN setup and optimize performance.

- High Availability Implementation: Ensured high availability of the site-to-site VPN connection by leveraging AWS's redundant tunnel setup, which establishes two tunnels for increased reliability- Multi-Region VPC Setup: Created two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in different regions - Tokyo and Singapore - to establish a robust network infrastructure. - EC2 Instance Deployment: Set up two EC2 instances within each VPC to serve as endpoints for the VPN connection.
